# Getting Started

### OncoDT Workflow
> Late-stage drug development failures are usually a consequence of ineffective targets. Thus, proper target identification is needed, which may be possible using computational approaches. In this work, we developed OncoDT, a deep learning (DL)-based method for predicting novel therapeutic targets. OncoDT is designed to reduce suboptimal target selection by identifying novel targets based on features of known effective targets using DL approaches.



### Prerequisites:

There are several required Python packages to run the code such as:
- numpy
- Scikit-learn
- keras
- tensorflow
- bio-embeddings
- pandas
These packages can be installed using pip or conda as the follwoing example
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Description:
#### *There are four folders:*

  **1.Data folder:** 
  > that includes 2 datasets: OncologyTT datasets, and the baseline method's datasets
  
  **2.Code folder:**
  > more files and details will be added...
     
  **3.EMBED folder:**
  > that has several files per cancer type for the generated Amino-acid sequences embeddings using ProTrans BERT embeddings
