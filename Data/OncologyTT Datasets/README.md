# OncologyTT Datasets

## This Dataset "OncologyTT" has been created for research purposes to contribute to Oncology research, more specifically "Identifying novel therapeutic targets to treat cancer".
### Description of all folders and files:
**It consists of Three main files, which are:**
1. all_positive_targets_wih_info.xlsx,Â  that are considered as "Positive Data Samples" including all genes that are "approved" target interacted with drugs for the 13 cancer types combined together in one file with other information.
2. all_positive_genes_with_info.xlsx, also considered "Positive Data Samples," including all cancer driver over-regulated genes for the 13 cancer types combined together in one file with other information.
3. all_negative_genes_with_info.xlsx that are considered as "Negative Data Samples" including all human genes randomly generated from a pool of Human Genes after excluding all positive genes for the 13 cancer types combined together in one file with other information.

**Each file has this information:**
- *[Entry, Gene names, Protein names, Amino-acid sequence, Class Label]*

		
**Each one of the previous files has a corresponding folder:**
1. Positive targets (Approved target)
2. Positive genes (Cancer driver genes) 
3. Negative genes (unlabeled genes where we consider negative samples) 
that consist of several files matching the cancer type.

**Also, there are two more folders:**
* STRING_PPI_Data_and_EMBED, that consists:


* Mapping Folder to map different identifiers 

**The Last file is:**
* target.Jason which in an informative file that includes all information of the approved drug-target and anti-cancer drugs in Jason format
